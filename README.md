                                                  0x16. C - Simple Shell
				General
	Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
	Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
	Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
	Who is Ken Thompson
	How does a shell work
	What is a pid and a ppid
	How to manipulate the environment of the current process
	What is the difference between a function and a system call
	How to create processes
	What are the three prototypes of main
	How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
	How to execute another program with the execve system call
	How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
	What is EOF / “end-of-file”?

                                                                Output
	Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0] (See below)
	Example of error with sh:

	$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
	/bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
	$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
	/bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
	$
	Same error with your program hsh:

	$ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
	./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
	$ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh
	./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
	$

					compilation
	Your shell will be compiled this way:
	gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

					Testing
	Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

	$ ./hsh
	($) /bin/ls
	hsh main.c shell.c
	($)
	($) exit
	$
	But also in non-interactive mode:

	$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
	hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
	$
	$ cat test_ls_2
	/bin/ls
	/bin/ls
	$
	$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
	hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
	hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
	$

1) Simple shell 0.1
	Write a UNIX command line interpreter.
	Usage: simple_shell
	Your Shell should:
	Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
	The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
	The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
	The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
	If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
	Handle errors.
	You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)
	You don’t have to:

	use the PATH
	implement built-ins
	handle special characters : ", ', `, \, *, &, #
	be able to move the cursor
	handle commands with arguments
	execve will be the core part of your Shell, don’t forget to pass the environ to it…

2) Simple shell 0.1 +
	Handle command lines with arguments

3) Simple shell 0.2 +
	Handle the PATH
	fork must not be called if the command doesn’t exist

4) Simple shell 0.3 +
	Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell
	Usage: exit
	You don’t have to handle any argument to the built-in exit

5) Simple shell 0.4 +
	Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment

6) Simple shell 0.1 +
	Write your own getline function
	Use a buffer to read many chars at once and call the least possible the read system call
	You will need to use static variables
	You are not allowed to use getline
	You don’t have to:
	be able to move the cursor

7) Simple shell 0.2 +
	You are not allowed to use strtok

8) Simple shell 0.4 +
	handle arguments for the built-in exit
	Usage: exit status, where status is an integer used to exit the shell
	
9) Simple shell 1.0 +
	Implement the setenv and unsetenv builtin commands
setenv
	Initialize a new environment variable, or modify an existing one
	Command syntax: setenv VARIABLE VALUE
	Should print something on stderr on failure
unsetenv
	Remove an environment variable
	Command syntax: unsetenv VARIABLE
	Should print something on stderr on failure

10) Simple shell 1.0 +
	Implement the builtin command cd:
	Changes the current directory of the process.
	Command syntax: cd [DIRECTORY]
	If no argument is given to cd the command must be interpreted like cd $HOME
	You have to handle the command cd -
	You have to update the environment variable PWD when you change directory
	man chdir, man getcwd

11) Simple shell 1.0 +
	Handle the commands separator ;

12) Simple shell 1.0 +
	Handle the && and || shell logical operators

13) Simple shell 1.0 +
	Implement the alias builtin command
	Usage: alias [name[='value'] ...]
	alias: Prints a list of all aliases, one per line, in the form name='value'
	alias name [name2 ...]: Prints the aliases name, name2, etc 1 per line, in the form name='value'
	alias name='value' [...]: Defines an alias for each name whose value is given. If name is already an alias
	replaces its value with value
	
14) Simple shell 1.0 +
	Handle variables replacement
	Handle the $? variable
	Handle the $$ variable

15) Simple shell 1.0 +
	Handle comments (#)

16) Simple shell 1.0 +
	Usage: simple_shell [filename]
	Your shell can take a file as a command line argument
	The file contains all the commands that your shell should run before exiting
	The file should contain one command per line
	In this mode, the shell should not print a prompt and should not read from stdin
